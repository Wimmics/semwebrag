What is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children?,Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children worldwide. 
What plays the crucial role in the Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1 and what increases the risk,DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission.
"How many children were infected by HIV-1 in 2008-2009, worldwide?","more than 400,000 children were infected worldwide, mostly through MTCT and 90% of them lived in sub-Saharan Africa. "
What is the role of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3 Like 1 (CCL3L1) in mother to child transmission of HIV-1?,"High copy numbers of CCL3L1, a potent HIV-1 suppressive ligand for CCR5, are associated with higher chemokine production and lower risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among South African infants"
What is DC-GENR and where is  it expressed?,"Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)) can interact with a plethora of pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed in placental capillary endothelial cells"
How does the presence of DC-SIGNR affect the MTCT of HIV-1?,the presence of DC-SIGNR at the placental endothelial cell surface may protect infants from HIV-1 infection by capturing virus and promoting its degradation/presentation. 
Why do low levels of DC-SIGNR enhance Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1?,"in placenta containing low levels of DC-SIGNR, HIV-1 would preferentially binds CCR5 on endothelial cells resulting in a loss of placental barrier integrity and enhanced passage of maternal HIV-1-infected cells in foetal circulation leading to MTCT of HIV-1"
"What is the percentage of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1, when there is no intervention?","Without specific interventions, the rate of HIV-1 mother-tochild transmission (MTCT) is approximately 15-45%"
Does C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) affect the transmission of HIV-1?,Genetic variants in CCR5 have been shown to influence vertical transmission of HIV-1. CCR5 promoter variants resulting in higher expression of the receptor were associated with increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1 among sub-Saharan Africans
How does Mannanose Binding Lectin (MBL) affect elimination of HIV-1 pathogen?,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immune receptor synthesised in the liver and secreted in the bloodstream in response to inflammation signal. MBL promotes pathogen elimination by opsonization and phagocytosis,"
How can CCR5's effect in HIV-1 transmission be reduced?,The 32-pb deletion polymorphism in CCR5 has be shown to protect from vertical transmission of HIV-1
