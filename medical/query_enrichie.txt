context : 



In the most heavilyaffected countries, such as Zimbabwe, HIV-1 is responsible for one third of all deaths among children under the age of five.
The survey results in 2010 and 2000 were standardized against the age structures of China's census population in 2010.
Especially in developing countries including China, ARTIs, mainly pneumonia, are the leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 years.
91Á4% (276/302) of co-infection cases were tested in the age group of 4 years old or younger ( Table 2) , but among all age groups, no statistical difference in co-infection rate was found (v 2 = 1Á83, P = 0Á8721).
However, it is not clear that it is any different or better at spread between people, and perhaps with the same pattern of most cases not causing further spread.


Many people are developing COPD, and the cause of this condition is complicated and not thoroughly understood.
Unfortunately, the new virusappears to be spreading from people much earlier in the course of illness, and even with mild symptoms - which was never documented for SARS.
Passive case finding is the routine practice in developing countries where sputum microscopy is performed to identify TB cases among people with persistent cough.
The majority of TB patients, 54.5% of sputum positive cases and 47.3% of bacteriologically confirmed cases, were from people 65 years or older.
The World Health Organization estimates that 300 million people are currently affected and that, by the year 2025, another 100 million will be affected by the disease [98] .
In the winter season there comes the time of upper and lower respiratory tract infections characterised by cough, dyspnea and eventually fever (influenza-like illness).Some of the patients, especially older people living alone affected by the disease ,may need hospitalization and eventually intensive care.
