OBJECTIVES:

Limited data are available in China to describe the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, especially in small–medium cities and rural areas.

To determine the viral etiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children, a 3-year study was conducted in Shenzhen, China.

The epidemiology of local viral etiologies is essential for the management of viral respiratory tract infections.
